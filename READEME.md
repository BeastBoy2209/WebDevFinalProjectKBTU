<span style="color:#0366d6;">FLOCK</span>
Platform for finding friends and organizing events
FLOCK is a modern social platform that helps you find friends, like-minded people and companies to spend time together. The application combines the functionality of finding new acquaintances through swipes, a system of themed badges and a mechanism for automatically organizing "random evenings".
ðŸš€ Key Features

Search for friends through swipes: Find interesting people and form new acquaintances in an intuitive interface
Activity Badges: Get unique achievements for participating in different types of events â€” "Bar Lover", "Traveler", "Board Games" and others
Random evenings: Join automatically created thematic events where the system selects the right company by itself
Automatic Telegram chats: When interests coincide or a group is formed for an event, the system automatically creates a group chat in Telegram, which deletes itself after the date of the event
